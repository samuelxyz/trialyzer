# trialyzer

An idea I had for a keyboard layout analyzer. It includes a specialized trigram typing test to allow users to measure their speed on arbitrary trigrams, and uses that data as the basis for layout analysis.

I'm also using this project as an opportunity to learn Python. This is my first time using Python for anything more substantial than CodingBat, and also my first project in VS Code, so things may be somewhat messy.
